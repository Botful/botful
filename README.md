### Installation

It is recommended by FIRST that you use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build your FRC projects, so that is the method that this guide will cover.

First, add this line to your `dependencies` block:

```gradle
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

Then, add this line to your `repositories` block:

```gradle
implementation 'com.github.Botful:org.botful:0.1.1'
```

### Getting Started

To get started, take a look at the [docs](https://botlin.gitbook.io/botlin/)!
